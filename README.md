▎Number Input and Average Calculator

This project is a Python script that allows users to enter five numbers using the keyboard.  This script records the entered numbers and calculates their average.  (The point is that there is no need to press enter to receive the output and the output will be displayed automatically after entering the fifth number and space)

▎Features

• Get output without pressing enter

• Input five numbers separated by spaces.

• Supports decimal numbers.

• Calculates and displays the average of the entered numbers.

▎Requirements

To run this code, you need the following library:

• keyboard

You can install the keyboard library using pip:
```bash
pip install keyboard
```

▎How to Use

1. Save the code in a Python file (for example, number_input_calculator.py).

2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.

3. Run the script:
```bash
      python number_input_calculator.py
```

4. You will be prompted to enter five numbers. Enter each number followed by a space. 

5. Press Enter when you are done or if you want to stop entering numbers early.

▎Example
```plaintext
Enter 5 numbers with spaces between:
3 5 7.5 10 2
```

The output will display the entered numbers and their average:
```plaintext
